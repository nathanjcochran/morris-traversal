# Morris Traversal

Implementation of [Morris Traversal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_traversal#Morris_in-order_traversal_using_threading)
of a binary tree. Morris traversal is an in-order traversal without recursion
(i.e.  using O(1) space), which leverages [threading](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Threaded_binary_tree).
Time-complexity is O(n), where n is the number of nodes.
